I'm Tobias van der Werff, an AI engineer based in The Netherlands.

You can find my blog [here](/blog/), where I write about topics such as AI, programming, and more. I'd describe it as a mix of contemplative essays and technical tutorials, with a focus on [practical insights](/2024/06/17/useful-knowledge.html).

You can also find me on [Github](https://github.com/tobiasvanderwerff) and [X](https://www.twitter.com/tobiasnvdw).

I occasionally do consulting, providing advice and implementation for real-world AI applications. Here are some areas in which I have expertise:

- Greenfield development of computer vision applications
- Implementing AI research papers
- Building, training, and deploying deep learning models
- Systems-level optimization of neural networks to make them run faster, e.g. using CUDA C++
