Greetings. I'm Tobias van der Werff, and this is a place for me to share things I've learned or find interesting.

In my day-to-day life, I am a software engineer building AI in The Netherlands, focusing primarily on deep learning-based computer vision.

I also do occasional consulting, providing advice and implementation regarding real-world AI applications. Here are some areas in which I have expertise:

- Greenfield development of computer vision applications
- Implementing AI research papers
- Building, training, and deploying deep learning models
- Systems-level optimization of neural networks to make them run faster, e.g. using CUDA C++
 
If you want to get in touch, feel free to [email me](mailto:tvdw@fastmail.com).
