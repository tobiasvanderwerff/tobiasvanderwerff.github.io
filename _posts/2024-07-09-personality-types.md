title: "Why You Should Take a Personality Assessment"

Humans are confusing. Granted, this shouldn't come as a great shock to most people. Personally, it only takes me a few minutes of watching TikTok to be convinced that the human mind is an inexplicable mystery. What's especially striking though, is how often we are equally confused about *ourselves* as we are about others.

When we get confused about others' behaviors, we can at least say, "Well, I can't read their thoughts". But this excuse doesn't work for our own thoughts and actions. After all, we literally can read our own minds. The confusing nature of our minds has made me realize that most people could benefit from learning more about themselves. Fortunately, there's a simple tool that can help: personality assessments.

Let's start with a motivating example from my own life. Back when I was in high school, I decided I wanted to become an accountant. Becoming an accountant sounded like a good idea to me because 1) you made a lot of money, and 2) it was high status and sounded important. Unfortunately, I didn't take sufficient time to verify whether becoming an accountant was a good fit for me personally.

In hindsight, striving to become an accountant was a terrible decision. The environment was an incredibly bad fit for me and I could not relate to my classmates whatsoever. It took me just three months to drop out of my studies and find myself back where I started.

Looking back on this experience, I realize that a poor grasp of my own personality was to blame for my misguided career choice. I had a clear plan for what my career would look like, but I had a poor grasp of how *I* would fit into that plan.

As Mike Tyson once said, "everybody has a plan, until they get punched in the face". In my case, fresh out of high school, life immediately handed me an uppercut to the jaw and put me back in my place. I eventually ended up in the right place, studying computer science and artificial intelligence, and being much happier in that environment.

This experience made me realize that earlier in life, it is especially valuable to do a good amount of exploration, trying out different things to discover what you like and don't like. Before committing to important life choices, you ideally want to test your plan with no strings attached, so you can experiment quickly and adjust your plans if things don't work out as expected. In my case, it probably would have been sufficient to spend a summer internship at an accountancy firm to realize that my personality was a bad fit for the average personality type there.

Although it's not uncommon for a teenager to be confused about who they are or want to be, it's not entirely uncommon for adults to struggle with their identity as well. So how can we help ourselves discover this identity?

## Getting to Know Ourselves

> To become acquainted with oneself is a terrible shock. - Carl Jung

Let's return to the idea of personality testing. In some sense, getting to know ourselves simply takes time and patience, as we inevitably make mistakes throughout life and learn from them. However, we can leverage psychological insights to understand our behavior and avoid unnecessary mistakes. In particular, personality testing is a tool that can speed up the process of self-discovery.

A personality test is an attempt to quantify human psychology into measurable variables[^1], like extroversion or neuroticism. Some of the more common personality frameworks include the [Big Five](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits) and [Myers-Briggs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator), along with various online tests like [PrinciplesYou](https://principlesyou.com/.). The Big Five assesses personality traits on five different dimensions: openness, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. The Myers-Briggs assessment decomposes personality into four dimensions: introversion or extroversion, sensing or intuition, thinking or feeling, and judging or perceiving. Each test offers a different perspective on your personality.

So, in what way are these personality tests helpful?

First of all, knowing your personality type can help you to navigate career choices more effectively. For example, if you're strongly introverted, you're probably better off not becoming a sales person. If you're highly disagreeable, a career as a nurse is probably not the most logical choice. If you're high in neuroticism, you might want to avoid high stress jobs like becoming a day trader. While there are exceptions, your personality traits should already give you a pretty good idea of what *not* to do with your life.

Secondly, learning about personality types is a great way to collaborate more effectively with other people. It's easier to understand people who are similar to you, but much harder to understand those who are radically different. Having a mental framework of personality is useful because at some point, we all collaborate with people who do not share our personality traits. If we don't make an effort to understand their behavior, frustration and miscommunication are bound to occur.

Here's an example. I recently found out about the difference between "linear" and "lateral" thinkers. A linear thinker tries to solve problems step-by-step in a structured way, while a lateral thinker tends to take a big-picture view and connects ideas in more intuitive ways. To a linear thinker, a lateral thinker can come across as chaotic and unstructured. Conversely, a linear thinker can come across as rigid and dogmatic to a lateral thinker. At the same time, these two ways of thinking are complementary, because they each have blind spots. Linear thinkers can compensate for the blind spots of lateral thinkers, and vice versa.

Finally, relationships are greatly helped by awareness of personality types. Finding a suitable partner tends to be a question of finding someone who's personality type is at least somewhat compatible with yours. The more divergent your personality type is to that of your partner, the harder it will be to understand each other, which will inevitably lead to friction. This is not to say that one should strive to find a partner who is exactly like them, but having some overlap in terms of personality traits tends to be better than having no overlap at all.

Above all, knowledge of one's personality should serve as a compass for making life decisions, both at the micro and macro level.

## The Two 'Yous'

If there's one thing I've learned, it's that getting to know yourself is not easy -- it takes time and effort to do well. Why is this the case? One explanation is that we humans have two contrary sides within us -- one emotional and one rational. Our emotional side can pull us in directions that are difficult to explain in hindsight.

Gaining control over our emotional selves starts with recognizing our emotional tendencies. Gaining more control over one's life involves recognizing this inner dichotomy and actively making the emotional self serve the rational self. For example, this might involve setting up [consistent daily habits](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40121378-atomic-habits) that reduce the influence of one's emotional self and focus on long-term goals.

To conclude, let me share a real-life example of successful personality testing. [Ray Dalio](https://goodreads.com/book/show/34536488-principles), one of the world's most successful investors, uses personality testing extensively as a tool to understand both himself and the people around him. In his company, Bridgewater, they use an idea called [baseball cards](https://www.principles.com/principles/a3d4f223-82d9-48ca-b12b-d00e344821c8) to describe the personality types of employees. These baseball cards contain various personality scores obtained from personality tests, providing perspective on someone's strengths and weaknesses, as well as their communication style. According to Dalio, striving to understand the psychology of each employee has been a crucial part of the success of the company.

## Where to Go from here

I encourage everyone to take a personality assessment at least once. It's worth trying out a few different ones to find out which works best for you -- personally, I've gained a lot by learning about the Big Five.[^2] It can be helpful have someone who knows you well take the test for you to reduce the chance of biased results.

The test itself shouldn't take more than an hour or two, and you might gain lifelong benefits from it. That seems like a pretty good investment to me.

[^2]: I've especially learned a lot from Jordan Peterson's lectures in this regard. I've also taken his online assessment at [https://www.understandmyself.com/](https://www.understandmyself.com/). It costs $10, but I found it to be worthwhile.
