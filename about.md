Greetings and welcome. I'm Tobias van der Werff, and this is a place for me to share things I've learned or find interesting.

In my day-to-day life, I am a software engineer working on AI in The Netherlands, currently focusing primarily on computer vision. I love implementing cutting-edge AI research and applying it to real-world problems.  

If you want to get in touch, feel free to [email me](mailto:tvdw@fastmail.com).
